# Micro-Rollups for Stacks

## Overview

This project implements a micro-rollups system for the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. Micro-rollups are designed to bundle small transactions into groups that can be processed together, increasing transaction throughput and speed without sacrificing decentralization.

## Purpose

The main goals of this project are:

1. Increase transaction speed on the Stacks network
2. Reduce transaction costs for users
3. Improve overall network efficiency
4. Maintain decentralization while scaling transaction processing

## Features

- Group multiple transactions into a single rollup
- Support for any fungible token that implements the `ft-trait`
- Automatic creation of new rollups when the current one is full
- Rollup submission with a fee to incentivize processors
- Batch processing of multiple rollups for increased efficiency
- Event system for tracking important contract actions
- Read-only functions to query rollup status and details

## Smart Contract Structure

The main contract file is `rollups.clar`, which contains the following key components:

- Constants for rollup size, batch size, and fees
- Data variables to track current rollup state
- Maps to store rollup data
- Functions to add transactions to rollups
- Functions to submit individual rollups and batches of rollups
- Event system for logging important actions
- Read-only functions to query rollup details

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

- Clarity SDK
- Stacks wallet (for deployment and interaction)

### Deployment

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Use the Clarity CLI to check and deploy the contract:

```bash
clarity check rollups.clar
clarity deploy rollups.clar
```

### Interacting with the Contract

To add a transaction to a rollup:

```clarity
(contract-call? .rollups add-transaction-to-rollup token-contract recipient amount)
```

To submit a single rollup:

```clarity
(contract-call? .rollups submit-rollup token-contract rollup-id)
```

To submit a batch of rollups:

```clarity
(contract-call? .rollups submit-rollups-batch token-contract (list rollup-id-1 rollup-id-2 rollup-id-3))
```

To get rollup details:

```clarity
(contract-call? .rollups get-rollup-details rollup-id)
```

## Development Roadmap

1. ✅ Implement batch processing of rollups
2. ✅ Add events for important actions (e.g., rollup creation, submission)
3. Implement additional security measures and access control
4. Optimize gas usage and storage efficiency
5. Add more sophisticated error handling and recovery mechanisms
